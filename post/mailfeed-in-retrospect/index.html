        <section>
            

<p>It&rsquo;s been a few weeks since I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/60lqvw/my_first_clojure_production_app_mailfeed">announced on /r/Clojure</a> I was finished working on Mailfeed, a service that emails you whenever an RSS feed updates. A comment on that thread suggested that I share a little about the technologies I used and some of the pitfalls I hit during development.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to talk about, so I thought I&rsquo;d just drop a nice big list of all the major tech, services and libraries, then move on to some of the more interesting challenges.</p>

<p>Major Tech used:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clojure(script)</li>
<li>Postgres</li>
<li>Nginx</li>
</ul>

<p>Services:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stathat</li>
<li>Rollbar</li>
<li>Papertrail</li>
<li>Mailgun</li>
<li>Digital Ocean</li>
</ul>

<p>Libraries:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ring</li>
<li>Compojure</li>
<li>Enlive (for emails)</li>
<li>Hiccup (for everything else)</li>
<li>HugSQL</li>
<li>Ragtime</li>
<li>Environ</li>
<li>Quartzite</li>
<li>Buddy</li>
<li>Component</li>
<li>clj-time</li>
<li>clj-stripe</li>
<li>clj-http</li>
<li>clj-rollcage</li>
</ul>

<p>The meat of the application is in the worker and the web apps. Both of these are
written entirely in Clojure with a <em>little</em> Clojurescript on one page in the
web app. I chose Postgres as a database simply because I already knew it really
 well.</p>

<h2 id="rss-processing-woes">RSS Processing Woes</h2>

<p>The first iteration of Mailfeed was basically the same app that exists
today with the worker existing as a background thread that was spun up whenever
the app booted. I designed the system using
<a href="https://github.com/stuartsierra/component">Component</a> early on, and
although I had a couple of small trip-ups along the way, I&rsquo;m very glad that I
chose it.</p>

<p>At that time the worker was very un-optimized, generated a lot
of errors, and died from time to time. Rebooting it meant rebooting the whole
application and this made the engineer in me cry. The worker is the <em>core</em> of the application; it does a lot of heavy lifting and is the main reason anyone would ever want to
actually use the service.</p>

<p>In my first spike I tried to convert the worker to using
<a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async">core.async</a>, but it started to feel like the wrong solution pretty quick. The library is more about communication
between two processes and what I wanted was a completely independent process that
would:</p>

<ol>
<li>Query the database at a regular interval</li>
<li>Get any feeds that needed to be updated</li>
<li>Process new entries for these feeds</li>
<li>Send any relevant emails to subscribers.</li>
</ol>

<p>On my next spike I sat down and wrote a &ldquo;Scheduler&rdquo; component in <a href="http://clojurequartz.info">Quartzite</a>, abstracting the task of feed refreshing into it&rsquo;s own job. I peppered in some error handling to ensure that <strong>when</strong> an error occurred, the job could clean up and continue. I made sure to fire the error off to <a href="https://rollbar.com">Rollbar</a> as I still wanted visibility on them.</p>

<p>Everything worked but the process was still really slow. At the time I had around 30 feeds that I wanted to refresh every 5 minutes. On average, the job was completing in about 40 seconds with an occasional spike up into 2 minutes. This was <em>technically</em> still within my acceptable time frame, but still felt a little extreme for such a small number of feeds. I added in some monitoring, sending the processing times of a few different functions to <a href="http://stathat.com">StatHat</a>, and left it for a few days to get a good baseline. I blocked off my next weekend to investigate and see what improvements could be made.</p>

<p>When I sat down on Saturday morning I poked around and determined the job was spending most of its time waiting for a response from a few different sites. Everything else was pretty speedy. Since network latency was completely outside of my ability to correct, I decided to look at parallelizing the feed fetching/processing task. I went back to core.async very briefly again, before remembering about <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/pmap">pmap</a>. I made the switch from:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">dorun </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">map </span><span class="nv">update-feed</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">get-feeds</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>To:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">dorun </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">pmap</span> <span class="nv">update-feed</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">get-feeds</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>After a lot more testing to make sure I hadn&rsquo;t missed anything, I found that I had brought the average total processing time for the job down to 2 seconds.</p>

<p>Woo hoo!</p>

<p>I decided to call that &ldquo;mission accomplished&rdquo; and closed my computer to go make breakfast. Even now with almost 3 times the number of feeds, the mean time for the job to complete is 3.113 seconds.</p>

<h2 id="the-monolith-with-two-doors">The Monolith with Two Doors</h2>

<p>At this point I was really happy with how the worker was performing, but still felt like it made sense to completely separate the worker from the web app in production. I wanted them to be able to exist on their own boxes so that I could fine tune each individually.</p>

<p>I mentioned previously that I was using component to try and keep the logical
pieces of Mailfeed as separate as possible. With Component you create &ldquo;systems&rdquo;
which is basically just a way of describing all your components and the
components they depend on to do their job. What I had was two systems
that shared a lot of the same components, but whose primary functions were
quite different.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s what I created. The &ldquo;Web System&rdquo; contained the all the routes, the
web handler, the database and the mailer, while the &ldquo;Worker System&rdquo; contained
the scheduler, the database, the mailer and the feed parser. When I go to
deploy, I build two JARs in <a href="http://boot-clj.com">Boot</a>:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-clojure" data-lang="clojure"><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">deftask</span> <span class="nv">build-web</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
 <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">comp </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">aot</span> <span class="ss">:namespace</span> <span class="o">&#39;#</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nv">mailfeed.web.core</span><span class="p">})</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">pom</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">uber</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">jar</span> <span class="ss">:main</span> <span class="ss">&#39;mailfeed.web.core</span>
       <span class="ss">:file</span> <span class="s">&quot;mailfeed-web.jar&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">target</span> <span class="ss">:dir</span> <span class="o">#</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s">&quot;target/web&quot;</span><span class="p">})))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">deftask</span> <span class="nv">build-worker</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
 <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">comp </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">aot</span> <span class="ss">:namespace</span> <span class="o">&#39;#</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nv">mailfeed.worker.core</span><span class="p">})</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">pom</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">uber</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">jar</span> <span class="ss">:main</span> <span class="ss">&#39;mailfeed.worker.core</span>
       <span class="ss">:file</span> <span class="s">&quot;mailfeed-worker.jar&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">target</span> <span class="ss">:dir</span> <span class="o">#</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="s">&quot;target/worker&quot;</span><span class="p">})))</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Overall I&rsquo;m actually really happy with this approach. The only thing I have to
be careful of is database migrations. If I make a change for one part of the
application, I need to make sure everything is backwards compatible, since there
is no mechanism for keeping both the worker and the web app in-sync. I do one
deploy, and then the other. This is mostly-OK, since it&rsquo;s generally a good idea
to write a migration to <em>add</em> a new thing, then, if you need to, write another
migration to <em>remove</em> the old thing once you&rsquo;ve verified it&rsquo;s not being used
anymore.</p>

<p>This leads me into my next topic; one that I&rsquo;m not very excited to share:</p>

<h1 id="deployment">Deployment</h1>

<p>Right now Mailfeed is deployed to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>. Everything is deployed with a couple of shell scripts and some preconfigured
&ldquo;droplets&rdquo; that I set up by hand then took snapshots of.</p>

<p>The above sentence should have made you go:</p>

<p><img
style="width: 30em"
src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/150988/24832190/5f719e88-1c67-11e7-8d44-e3ddec4b3dba.jpg" /></p>

<p>Yeah&hellip; I&rsquo;m right there with you. Dumb! Dumb. Baaad Mike.</p>

<p>But it works! I ran a failure-scenario a couple of months ago and I managed to
get everything up and running again within 30 minutes. That&rsquo;s not &hellip; great, but
considering how mission-critical the application is, it&rsquo;s not bad either.
And if I had paying customers then I would spend the time to rework everything
through Ansible.</p>

<p>If I was starting again today, then Ansible would definitely be technology I would consider to provision these servers for me. I&rsquo;ve used in the past and had very a very good experience with it. Daniel Higginbotham has also recently released a book &ldquo;<a href="https://gum.co/gHcWk">Deploying Your First Clojure App &hellip;From the Shadows</a>&ldquo;
that I <em>wish</em> had existed before I started Mailfeed.</p>

<h1 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written a bit about monitoring, but in summary I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Track of errors with Rollbar</li>
<li>Send some key stats with Stathat</li>
<li>Monitor hardware with Digital Ocean Monitoring</li>
<li>Logs with Papertrail</li>
</ul>

<p>I experimented a bit with Riemann early on but found it was a little over my head at the time. It certainly seems capable of tracking most of the above, without the limitations imposed by having to stick to the Free account tiers.</p>

<h1 id="what-s-the-lesson">What&rsquo;s the lesson?</h1>

<p>I was really happy with using Clojure and I didn&rsquo;t have any huge surprises during development. But every story should have a lesson! I think the big lessons I learned weren&rsquo;t really related to the actual development process, but more to the things that need to go along around it. If I had to pick something I needed to improve it would be to do a little more up front market research and planning instead of just jumping in and building something I and a few friends of mine wanted.</p>

<p>Hopefully some of that was insightful. If you&rsquo;re reading this and are curious about something specific, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/cramm">Twitter</a>.</p>
