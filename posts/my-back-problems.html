      <h1>My Back Problems</h1>
<p>"It could take 12 to 18 months to correct this issue" my chiropractor said. He moved on to listing exercises he wanted me to start doing every day, but I wasn't listening. My brain was still stuck on the timeline of when my life would go back to being normal. My back problems seemed to escalate so quickly. In the grand scheme of things, the issues with my back are minor, and correctable with some consistent, routine exercise and therapy visits. But I couldn't help feeling like something had been taken away from me. I'm not the most athletic man on the planet, but I did exercise regularly and I love walking my dogs, running, swimming, lifting weights, and other wise "working out" without having to worry about any pain. That all changed at the beginning of 2023, on New Years day when I was taking down our Christmas lights.</p><p>Leading up to New Years I had been experiencing some stiffness in my upper back, so I decided to take a week off from any strenuous exercise. I would be damned though if I was going to sit on the couch and watch YouTube all day, so I decided to be useful. While my wife was out walking one of the dogs, I was going to take down some Christmas decorations.</p><p> I had set up the lights on the front porch, wrapping them around the entire  length of the top railing. I didn't have to stand on a ladder to unclip them  from the gutter. But something about the repetitive motion of unwinding them  from the railing caused my entire back to completely seize up. Pain shot  through my entire body and all I could do was look up, grab my lower back, and  fall back into a lawn chair that happened to be on the porch. There I stayed  for a few minutes, breathing through the pain. When it started to subside, I  pulled myself up, stumbled inside, up the stairs, and carefully lay down on my  bed. Over the next half hour the pain died down enough for me to make my way to  a medicine cabinet where I swallowed an extra-strength Ibuprofen.</p><p>My wife returned to find our front porch in complete disarray, and her husband lying immobile on the couch, surrounded by pillows. After I explained what happened, she asked a reasonable question: "Do you want to go to an emergency room?" Of course I said "No." This wasn't a big issue - just some back pain. Clearly I overworked it, and my 36-year-old back was simply "acting up" as they obviously do sometimes. Let someone who really needs help go to a doctor. I'll be fine with some rest and be back to normal in a few days.</p><p>A few days later I was able to move around again with minimal pain. I could take my dogs for a walk, but now I was having two new problems: for some reason my left leg, and my left shoulder were hurting. Walking for more than 45 minutes resulted in my knee and lower leg aching for the next day, and any arm movement like a push-up, or reaching out to the side, would cause my shoulder to hurt. I bought gel-pack on Amazon and began icing my knee and shoulder whenever they hurt. I was still thinking that this was all the result of some strenuous activity, and I could solve it with a little rest. For the most part things improved. At least, they did up  up until I slipped on some ice while I was out walking my dog one Sunday morning.</p><p> The weather in Calgary had been clearing up, but there were still icy patches  here and there. These weren't much of a problem - they were visible and easy to  avoid. Sometime during the night on January 21st it snowed, cloaking these now  deadly patches of ice. On the 22nd I got up early and took our younger dog Nova  for a walk. I took the usual route through some quiet residential streets  before turning down a short alleyway and heading into a park. Most of the park  was still covered in compressed, bumpy snow, and my knee was still aching  on-and-off, so I made a bee-line to the singuler bike path, and turned in the  direction of home.</p><p>About halfway home I noticed some people and a dog on the path ahead of me, coming in my direction. I recognized them-they were a couple I had seen many times before. Their dog was one of the few dogs that Nova got along with. I waved at them, and kept moving forward. I  stepped onto what I thought would be pavement, but was actually smooth, friction-less ice. My leg, I don't remember which one, flew out in front of me. My ass hit the ground first, then my whole body rolled backward, and the back of my head hit second. In the moment, I was fine. I felt more embarrassed than anything else. But there was no way my friends didn't see me wipe out, so I got up, swore at myself for being stupid, and brushed the snow off myself. As I got closer to my friends, they called out, asking if I was OK and if I needed help getting home. I assured them I was fine, because of course I was. Nothing bad happens to me! I told them my ass hurt, but I was headed straight home anyways. We talked for a little bit more before saying goodbye and moving on. When I was almost home I started to get a headache, and my ass really started to ache. I took the rest of the day off, again, to rest.</p><p>The next day, all the muscles down the front of my neck were stiff. Even minor movements like getting in and out of bed were painful. Clearly I had whiplash. I knew the symptoms since my mother had gone through it when she had been in a minor car accident while I was a teenager. This went away in a couple of days, but the pain in my glutes continued on for the next week. It's a hard pain to describe. Sitting was OK, but rolling back? Nuh-uh. Bending backward or forward hurt, and there was no way I was lifting any thing heavy.</p><p>I endured all this, the knee and lower leg aches, a sore ass, a stiff neck, and a painful shoulder, and an intermittent pain right behind my left shoulder near my spine, for another week before I finally booked in an appointment with a Chiropractor. By the time I got into his office and was talking with him, it had been a full 6 weeks since I had done any kind of strenuous workout, and I was beginning to go crazy. I told him this. He ordered x-rays of my cervical spine, gave me a quick adjustment, and prescribed me 5 exercise to do 3 times a day. One of them involved a foam roller, which I happened to already have. His diagnosis was a few things: My spine had a small twist in it to the left, my hip & sacrum were out of alignment, and my posture was "all fucked up" (my words, not his.)</p><p>According to him, my knee and lower leg pain are almost certainly caused by the misalignment in my hips plus my shitty posture. If I could get a handle on those, then this pain would eventually go away.</p><p>The pain in my left shoulder is most likely an injury to the Supraspinatus muscle - one of the muscles in our rotator cuff. It is one of the most common shoulder injuries that people get, especially men "approaching their 40s." I had a mini mid-life crisis moment when he told me that. Solving this problem was going to require some time and minor exercises to make sure it healed correctly. The pain behind my shoulder blade was most likely a rib joint that had somehow come out of place. I say "was" because it gone now.</p><p>The last part of my story revolves around my x-rays. I went to a diagnostic center near my home a few days after my first chiropractic appointment, changed into embarrassing gown and sat down to wait my turn with the radiologist. I'm embarrassed to admit that I cried. It's for the dumbest reason you can think of: I felt like this was all my fault. If I had taken better care of myself, taken better care of my posture, maybe exercised my back a little bit more, or otherwise "put in more effort," then I wouldn't be sitting in that depressing hallway, alone, wasting someones time.</p><p>I had three pictures taken of my neck. One of them required me to face the x-ray machine and open my mouth wide so that they could get an accurate picture of some specific bones without my teeth and jaw in the way. I got to see the images at my next appointment with my chiropractor, and they confirmed what he had told me last week: That my posture sucked. I asked how long it could take to correct, and he said "12 to 18 months". That hurt more than my back seizing up, or slipping on the ice at the park. The fact that it could take over a year for me to get back to normal made my heart sink. I somehow powered through the rest of the appointment, listening to his suggestions and him prescribing even more exercises. My list is now up to 6 resistance-based exercises that I do once every other day, 6 exercises that I do once every single day, and 11 stretches that I do 3 times every day. I also need to be more cognizant of my posture while I'm working. He told me to try and switch it up every so often - don't sit in a chair, on an exercise ball, or stand too long for any one period of time. Oh and no running or biking for the foreseeable future until things start moving in the right direction. Apparently I'm allowed to swim.</p>
