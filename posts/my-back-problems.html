      <h1>My Back Problems</h1>
<p>"It could take 12 to 18 months to correct this issue" my chiropractor said yesterday before he starting listing off exercises that he wanted me to start doing every day. I barely heard him. My brain was still stuck on the timeline of when my life would go back to being normal. </p><p>In the grand scheme of things, the issues with my back are minor issues that are correctable with some consistent, routine exercise and doctors visits. But I couldn't help feeling like something had been taken away from me. I'm not the most athletic man on the planet, but I did exercise regularly and I love walking my dogs, running, swimming, lifting weights, and other wise "working out" without having to worry about any pain. That all changed at the beginning of 2023, on literally New Years day when I was taking down our Christmas lights.</p><p>Leading up to New Years I had been experiencing some pain in my upper back, and I had resigned myself to taking a week off from any strenuous exercise. I would be damned, however, if I was just going to sit on the couch and watch YouTube all day, so I decided to be "useful". I had set up our lights on our front porch, wrapping porch, wrapping them around the top railing and weaving them through the perpendicular bars. I didn't have to stand on a ladder or reach high overhead to un-clip them from a gutter, but something about the repetitive motion of unwinding them from the railing caused my entire back to completely seize up.</p><p>I was in more pain then I had been in a long time. I fell back into a red lawn chair that we had kept out over winter and there I stayed for what felt like ten minutes just breathing through the pain. At some point I pulled myself up, leaving the lights where they were, stumbled inside, up the stairs and carefully lay down on my bed where I stayed for at least the next half hour while the pain slowly subsided. At some point I got up, made my way to a medicine cabinet and took an extra-strength Ibuprofen.</p><p>My wife returned some time later from walking one of our dogs to find our front porch in complete disarray, and her husband lying immobile on our couch with the foot rest fully extended, surrounded by pillows. After I explained what happened, she asked a reasonable question: "Do you want to go to an emergency room?"</p><p>Of course I said "No." This wasn't a big issue - just some back pain. Clearly I overworked it, and my 36-year-old back was simply "acting up" as they obviously do sometimes. Let someone who <i>really</i> needs help go to a doctor. I'll be fine with some rest and be back to normal in a few days. </p><p>A few days later I was able to move around again with minimal pain. I could take my dogs for a walk, but now I was having two new problems: for some reason my left leg, and my left shoulder were hurting. Walking for more than 45 minutes would result in my knee and lower leg aching for the next day, and any movement of my arm like a push-up, or reaching out to the side would cause my shoulder to hurt. I bought gel-pack on Amazon and began icing my knee and shoulder whenever they hurt. I was still thinking that this was all the result of some strenuous activity, and could be solved by a little rest. For the most part things slightly improved, right up until I slipped magnificently on some ice while I was out walking my dog Sunday morning.</p><p>The weather in Calgary had been clearing up, but there were still icy patches here and there. These weren't a problem - they were visible and easy to avoid. Sometime during the night on January 21st it snowed, cloaking the deadly ice patches in a beautiful white blanket. On the 22nd I got up early and took my younger dog Nova for a walk. I took our usual route through some quiet residential streets before I turned down a short alleyway and headed into a off-leash dog park. Since most of the park was still covered in compressed, bumpy snow, and my knee had been hurting lately, I made a bee-line to the bike path and turned in the direction to head home. </p><p>About halfway home I noticed some people and a dog turn onto the path in front of me and head my way. I recognized them-they were a couple I had seen many times before, and knew them and their dog by name. Their dog was one of the few dogs that Nova got along with. I waved at them, and kept moving forward.</p><p>I absentmindedly stepped forward onto what I thought would be pavement, but was actually smooth, friction-less ice. My leg, I don't remember which one, flew out in front of me, my ass hit the ground first, then my whole body heaved backward and the back of my head hit second.</p><p>In the moment, I was fine. I felt more embarrassed than anything else-there was no way my friends <i>didn't</i> see me wipe out-so I quickly got up, swore at myself for being stupid, and brushed the snow off myself. As I got closer to my friends, they called out, asking if I was OK and if I needed help getting home. I assured them I was fine, (because of course I was, nothing bad happens to me!), and that my ass hurt, but I was headed straight home anyways. We talked for a little bit more before saying goodbye and moving on. When I was almost home I started to get a headache, and my ass <em>really</em> started to ache. I took the rest of the day off, again, and gave myself the day to rest.</p><p>The next day I could barely move my head. All the muscles down the front of my neck were stiff, and even minor movements like getting in and out of bed were painful. Clearly I had whiplash-I knew the symptoms since my mother had gone through it when she had been in a minor car accident while I was a teenager. This went away in a couple of days, but the pain in my glutes continued on for the next week. It's a hard pain to describe. Sitting was OK, but rolling back? nuh-uh. Bending backward or forward hurt. Especially when trying to lift things.</p><p>I endured all this, the knee and lower leg aches, a sore ass, a stiff neck, and a painful shoulder, and an intermittent pain right behind my left shoulder near my spine, for another week before I finally booked in an appointment with a Chiropractor. By the time I got into his office and was talking with him, it had been a full 6 weeks since I had done any kind of strenuous workout, and I was beginning to go crazy. I told him this.</p><p>He ordered x-rays of my cervical spine, gave me a quick adjustment, and prescribed me 5 exercise to do 3 times a day. One of them involved a foam roller, which I happened to already have. His diagnosis was a few things: My spine had a small twist in it to the left, my hip & sacrum were out of alignment, and my posture was "all fucked up" (my words, not his.)</p><p>According to him, my knee and lower leg pain are almost certainly caused by the misalignment in my hips plus my shitty posture. If I could get a handle on those, then this pain would eventually go away.</p><p>The pain in my left shoulder is most likely an injury to the Supraspinatus muscle - one of the muscles in our rotator cuff. It is one of the most common shoulder injuries that people get, especially men "approaching their 40s." I had a mini mid-life crisis moment when he told me that. Solving this problem was going to require some time and minor exercises to make sure it healed correctly.</p><p>The pain behind my shoulder blade was most likely a rib joint that had somehow come out of place. I say "was" because it gone now.</p><p>The last part of my story revolves around my x-rays. I went to a diagnostic center near my home a few days after my first chiropractic appointment, changed into embarrassing gown and sat down to wait my turn with the radiologist. I'm embarrassed to admit that I cried. It's for the dumbest reason you can think of: I felt like this was all my fault. If I had taken better care of myself, taken better care of my posture, maybe exercised my back a little bit more, or otherwise "put in more effort," then I wouldn't be sitting in that depressing hallway, alone, wasting someones time.</p><p>I had three pictures taken of my neck. One of them required me to face the x-ray machine and open my mouth wide so that they could get an accurate picture of some specific bones without my teeth and jaw in the way. I got to see the images at my next appointment with my chiropractor, and they confirmed what he had told me last week: That my posture sucked. I asked how long it could take to correct, and he said "12 to 18 months". That hurt more than my back seizing up, or slipping on the ice at the park. The fact that it could take <i>over a year</i> for me to get back to normal made my heart sink. I somehow powered through the rest of the appointment, listening to his suggestions and him prescribing even more exercises. My list is now up to 6 resistance-based exercises that I do once every other day, 6 exercises that I do once every single day, and 11 stretches that I do 3 times every day. I also need to be more congnizant of my posture while I'm working. He told me to try and switch it up every so often - don't sit in a chair, on an exercise ball, or stand too long for any one period of time.</p><p>Oh and no running or biking for the foreseeable future until things start moving in the right direction. Apparently I'm allowed to swim.</p>
