      <h1>Goodbye Hugo</h1>
<p><a href='https://gohugo.io/'>Hugo</a> has been the backbone of my blog for over five years now, but it's time to say goodbye. I came to this decision after I wanted to try out a new, simpler site design and couldn't get even the most basic theme working with the older version of Hugo I was running. To use the design I wanted, it seemed I would have to start entirely from scratch and port my old posts over to whatever the "new" way was, then iterate on everything until I was happy with it.</p><p>All of this seemed like too much work. Instead, I decided to move on from Hugo and figure out how to generate a static site from scratch. I'm a big fan of Clojure, and I've been looking for some excuse to give <a href='https://babashka.org/'>Babashka</a> a try.</p><p>The site is now being generated entirely through Clojure via Babashka, including the post you're reading right now! This might sound like it was <em>more</em> work than just getting everything to work with Hugo, but it only took a few hours to write the appropriate methods to not only parse markdown into HTML but to:</p><ul><li>Be able to have a process running that can watch for any changes, recompiling  when needed.</li><li>Launch a web server to serve my local site</li><li>Render templates, static pages</li><li>Handle some custom routing</li></ul><p>On top of all this, everything feels much <em>simpler</em> to understand and straightforward to modify.</p><p><a href='https://github.com/mcramm/site'>Check it out</a>!</p>
