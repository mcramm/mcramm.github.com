Over the past few years my VIM configuration has gotten out of hand. I

The first thing I decided to do was decide which plugins I was using and
which ones were just taking up space. This list may change, but I am
currently using the following plugins on a daily basis (in no particular
order):

1. [SnipMate](https://github.com/msanders/snipmate.vim)
2. [Surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)
3. [Unimpared](https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired)
4. [LustyJuggler](https://github.com/sjbach/lusty)
5. [Command-T](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3025)
6. [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
7. [NERD Tree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
8. [NERD Commenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter)
9. [Endwise](https://github.com/tpope/vim-endwise)

If you go through that list, you'll notice that [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope) is the author
for a majority of them. The guy has created a ton of useful plugins and
I definitely recommend trolling through his projects for anything useful.
