Over the past few years my VIM configuration has gotten out of hand. I
have tried to maintain it as best I can, but its time for a reboot! I
was inspired by Avdi Grimm's recent [Emacs Reboot](
http://avdi.org/devblog/category/emacs-reboot/ ) series and decided to
do something similar with VIM.

I work on a Mac, which means I prefer MacVim to the "command-line"
(ugly) version. The latest snapshot for Snow Leopard can be found at
[http://code.google.com/p/macvim/](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/).
Installing is as easy as you would expect. Simply download the
snapshot, drag MacVim.app to Applications and move the mvim script to
folder in your $PATH.

{% highlight bash %}
sudo cp mvim /usr/bin;
{% endhighlight %}
Then make it executeable.
{% highlight bash %}
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/mvim
{% endhighlight %}

The first thing I decided to do was decide which plugins I was using and
which ones were just taking up space. This list may change, but I am
currently using the following plugins on a daily basis (in no particular
order):

1. [SnipMate](https://github.com/msanders/snipmate.vim)
2. [Surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)
3. [Unimpared](https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired)
4. [LustyJuggler](https://github.com/sjbach/lusty)
5. [Command-T](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3025)
6. [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
7. [NERD Tree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
8. [NERD Commenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter)
9. [Endwise](https://github.com/tpope/vim-endwise)

If you go through that list, you'll notice that [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope) is the author
for a majority of them. The guy has created a ton of useful plugins and
    I definitely recommend trolling through his projects for anything
    useful.
