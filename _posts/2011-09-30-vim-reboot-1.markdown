Over the past few years my VIM configuration has gotten out of hand. I
have tried to maintain it as best I can, but its time for a reboot! I
was inspired by Avdi Grimm's recent [Emacs Reboot](
http://avdi.org/devblog/category/emacs-reboot/ ) series and decided to
do something similar with VIM.

I work on a Mac, which means I prefer to use MacVim where possible. The
latest snapshot for Snow Leopard can be found at
[http://code.google.com/p/macvim/](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/).
Installing is as easy as you would expect. Simply download the
snapshot, drag MacVim.app to Applications and move the mvim script to
folder in your path.

{% highlight bash %}
sudo mv mvim /usr/bin
{% endhighlight %}

Using ````mvim```` from the command line at this point should launch
MacVim as you would expect.

At this point, you have two options. You can continue with this series
of posts on customizing your environment by hand, or you can check out
[Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) and get a very good default
configuration.

The first thing I wanted to do was fix the (ugly) default colorscheme
and setup MacVim to work in fullscreen mode.

Create a ````.gvimrc```` file:
{% highlight bash %}
touch ~/.gvimrc
{% endhighlight %}

And add the following options to it:

{% highlight vim %}
if has("gui_macvim")
    " Make fullscreen mode take up the full screen
    set fuoptions=maxhorz,maxvert

    " Command-Return toggles full screen mode
    macmenu Window.Toggle\ Full\ Screen\ Mode key=<D-CR>
endif

" Start with the toolbar hidden
set guioptions-=T

" Set the color scheme
set background=dark
color ir_black
{% endhighlight %}


The first thing I decided to do was decide which plugins I was using and
which ones were just taking up space. This list may change, but I am
currently using the following plugins on a daily basis (in no particular
order):

1. [SnipMate](https://github.com/msanders/snipmate.vim)
2. [Surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)
3. [Unimpared](https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired)
4. [LustyJuggler](https://github.com/sjbach/lusty)
5. [Command-T](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3025)
6. [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
7. [NERD Tree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
8. [NERD Commenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter)
9. [Endwise](https://github.com/tpope/vim-endwise)

If you go through that list, you'll notice that [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope) is the author
for a majority of them. The guy has created a ton of useful plugins and
I definitely recommend trolling through his projects for anything useful.
