title: Vim Reboot 1

Over the past few years my Vim configuration has gotten out of hand.
I've tried to maintain it as best I can, but its time for a reboot. I
was inspired by Avdi Grimm's recent [Emacs Reboot](
http://avdi.org/devblog/category/emacs-reboot/ ) series and decided to
do something similar for Vim.

I work on a Mac, which means I prefer to use MacVim where possible. The
latest snapshot for Snow Leopard can be found at
[http://code.google.com/p/macvim/](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/)
and installing is as easy as you would expect. Simply download the
snapshot, drag MacVim.app to Applications and move the mvim script to
folder in your path:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo mv mvim /usr/bin
{% endhighlight %}

Using `mvim` from the command line at this point should launch
MacVim as you would expect.

At this point, you have two options. You can continue with this series
of posts on customizing your environment by hand, or you can check out
[Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) and get a very good default
configuration. I used this initially and copied a bit of my
configuration directly from it.

The first thing I wanted to do was fix the (ugly) default color scheme
and setup MacVim to work in full screen mode.

Create a `.gvimrc` file:
{% highlight bash %}
touch ~/.gvimrc
{% endhighlight %}

And add the following to it:

{% highlight vim %}
if has("gui_macvim")
    " Make fullscreen mode take up the full screen
    set fuoptions=maxhorz,maxvert

    "set the font
    set guifont=Bitstream\ Vera\ Sans\ Mono:h10

    " Command-Return toggles full screen mode
    macmenu Window.Toggle\ Full\ Screen\ Mode key=<D-CR>
endif

" Start with the toolbar hidden
set guioptions-=T

" Set the color scheme
set background=dark
color ir_black
{% endhighlight %}

Substitute the "Bitstream" font and "ir_black" color scheme with the
font/scheme of your preference. I've found that these two work the best
for me.

[Bitstream can be found here](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/ttf-bitstream-vera/1.10/). Installation details can be found elsewhere on the website.

And ir_black can be found in a bunch of places, [the best of which is
here](https://github.com/mcramm/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/colors/ir_black.vim). You can use this scheme by doing:
{% highlight bash %}
  mkdir -p ~/.vim/colors
   mv ir_black.vim ~/.vim/colors/
{% endhighlight %}

Running `mvim` from the command line should present the following:

Next I'll start setting up some standard vim options and a couple of
custom mappings I use quite frequently.
