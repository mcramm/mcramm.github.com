### Plugins in VIM

Vim plugins can be enabled in a variety of ways. Sometimes all you
need to do is copy the *plugin*.vim to `~/.vim/plugin`. Other times
the plugin comes packaged as a `.vba` file that you need to open in vim
and source by executing `:so %`. In any case, you should always read the
plugin's README *first*.

Some people have gone out of there way to write vim plugins that make
installing *other* plugins even easier. I have come across two such plugins
in my research.

[Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) was created by [Tim
Pope](http://tbaggery.com/) and has been around for a while. A couple
colleagues of mine use it and seem to really like it.

[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) was inspired by
[Bundler's](http://gembundler.com/) method of keeping track of rubygems
for projects.

For the sake of these posts, I'm going to stick with the "vanilla"
method of installing plugins. If you're curious though, I would
recommend trying out both of those plugin management solutions as they
can make organizing your plugins much easier.

### Tab Completion

I got to admit, all of the setup done in the previous posts was
incredibly frustrating without tab completion. [SuperTab](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1643)
is the best solution I've found. The plugin comes as a `.vba`
file, which means installing it requires you to open the file
up and type `:so %`.

Now when you are in your editor and hit `tab`, a handy dandy list of all
possible matches will appear:

### Nerd Commenter

Commenting lines in and out can get pretty arduous if you do it a lot.
With [Nerd Commenter](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1218), you can
comment a line in or out by doing `<Leader>ci`. Make sure that you have
`filetype plugin indent on` in your `~/.vimrc`, as the plugin will use
the appropriate comments for the language you're in. There are a couple
of other commenting formats available with the plugin, so you should
look through the vimscripts page and try a few commands out.

To install, simply download the `.zip` file to `~/.vim/`, and unpack it.
