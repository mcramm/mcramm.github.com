Last night I had a dream about you<br />
In this dream I'm dancing right beside you<br />
And it looked like everyone was having fun<br />
the kind of feeling I've waited so long<br />
<br />
Don't stop come a little closer<br />
As we jam the rythm gets stronger<br />
There's nothing wrong with just a little little fun<br />
We were dancing all night long<br />
<br />
The time is right to put my arms around you<br />
You're feeling right<br />
You wrap your arms around too<br />
But suddenly I feel the shining sun<br />
Before I knew it this dream was all gone<br />
<br />
Oh I don't know what to do<br />
About this dream and you<br />
I wish this dream comes true<br />
<br />
Oh I don't know what to do<br />
About this dream and you<br />
We'll make this dream come true
