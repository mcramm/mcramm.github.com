### Some other useful plugins

There are some other plugins remaining that I find quite useful,
but don't need to do much configuration for:

1. [SnipMate](https://github.com/msanders/snipmate.vim) - For quickly creating your own custom snippets.
2. [Surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) - For working with surrounding brackets. Need to change your `"`'s to `'`'s ? or `()` to `[]`? Use Surround.vim.
3. [Unimpared](https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired) - Mappings for common operations.
4. [NERD Tree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) - Sidebar that contains the structure of the current project. Useful for common file operations.
5. [Endwise](https://github.com/tpope/vim-endwise) - Adds the 'end' keyword to certain structures automatically in Ruby.

Each of these plugins can be installed by simply downloading the
zip and unpacking it in your `~/.vim` directory.
