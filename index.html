    My name is Michael Cramm. I am a software developer living in
    Calgary, AB. This is a landing page I built for anyone trying to
    contact me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I &#9825; Ruby, but also have signifigant experience with other
      languages. When I'm not coding, then I'm out trying to find coffee
      so I can get back to work.

    This is the <a href='https://github.com/mcramm/mcramm.com'>3rd</a> iteration of my landing page. It is written using
      <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a> and is
      hosted on <a href='http://www.heroku.com/'>Heroku</a>.
