    <h1>Vim Reboot 5 </h1>
    <h3 id='plugins_in_vim'>Plugins in VIM</h3>

<p>Vim plugins can be enabled in a variety of ways. Sometimes all you need to do is copy the <em>plugin</em>.vim to <code>~/.vim/plugin</code>. Other times the plugin comes packaged as a <code>.vba</code> file that you need to open in vim and source by executing <code>:so %</code>. In any case, you should always read the plugin&#8217;s README <em>first</em>.</p>

<p>Some people have gone out of there way to write vim plugins that make installing <em>other</em> plugins even easier. I have come across two such plugins in my research.</p>

<p><a href='https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen'>Pathogen</a> was created by <a href='http://tbaggery.com/'>Tim Pope</a> and has been around for a while. A couple colleagues of mine use it and seem to really like it.</p>

<p><a href='https://github.com/gmarik/vundle'>Vundle</a> was inspired by <a href='http://gembundler.com/'>Bundler&#8217;s</a> method of keeping track of rubygems for projects.</p>

<p>For the sake of these posts, I&#8217;m going to stick with the &#8220;vanilla&#8221; method of installing plugins. If you&#8217;re curious though, I would recommend trying out both of those plugin management solutions as they can make organizing your plugins much easier.</p>

<h3 id='tab_completion'>Tab Completion</h3>

<p>I got to admit, all of the setup done in the previous posts was incredibly frustrating without tab completion. <a href='http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1643'>SuperTab</a> is the best solution I&#8217;ve found. The plugin comes as a <code>.vba</code> file, which means installing it requires you to open the file up and type <code>:so %</code>.</p>

<p>Now when you are in your editor and hit <code>tab</code>, a handy dandy list of all possible matches will appear:</p>

<h3 id='nerd_commenter'>Nerd Commenter</h3>

<p>Commenting lines in and out can get pretty arduous if you do it a lot. With <a href='http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1218'>Nerd Commenter</a>, you can comment a line in or out by doing <code>&lt;Leader&gt;ci</code>. Make sure that you have <code>filetype plugin indent on</code> in your <code>~/.vimrc</code>, as the plugin will use the appropriate comments for the language you&#8217;re in. There are a couple of other commenting formats available with the plugin, so you should look through the vimscripts page and try a few commands out.</p>

<p>To install, simply download the <code>.zip</code> file to <code>~/.vim/</code>, and unpack it.</p>
